# MongoDB Structure Exercises

## üìÑ Description

This repository contains two MongoDB modeling exercises for the Optician Shop *Cul d'Ampolla* project.  
The goal is to design and organize a NoSQL database using MongoDB, representing customers, employees, suppliers, and glasses sales.  

- **Exercise 1**: Client-centered view. Each client contains their data and shopping history.  
- **Exercise 2**: Glasses-centered view. Each glasses model contains its details and the list of clients who bought it.  

## üíª Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**
- **MongoDB Compass** - GUI for MongoDB
- **Docker** - For local MongoDB container setup
- **Git & GitHub** - Version control
- **Moon Modeler** - For ER diagrams
